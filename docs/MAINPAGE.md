# SHA-256 C Library

This is a C implementation of the SHA-256 algorithm.

### Secure Hash Algorithm

The Secure Hash Algorithms are a family of cryptographic hash functions published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as a U.S. Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS).

SHA-256, first published in 2001, has a 128-bit security.

This implementation directly follows the standard available at https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.180-4.pdf.
